# Test Framework

It's not very polished but it's functional.

# Structure

- [Jupyter-Notebook](jupyter/README.md): the finalized testing that contains functions for generating data and writing data. You can write your own script using the functions to test the data.
- [Artifact](artifact/README.md): the testing data in the very early days of my learning and writing Verilog, it's messy. It's not deleted for the usability of older test benches
- **`sim_input/`**: the input data generated by Jupyter-Notebook
- **`sim_output/`**: the memory data generated by `quartus/simulation/modelsim/save_mem.do`
